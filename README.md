# SpaceInvaders

## How to compile
Call `make`

## How to run the game
./invaders after compiling

## Controls:
W - Shoot  
A - Move left  
D - Move right


# TODO:
- Movement sucks, improve it to be smoother
- Don't hang the game when invaders die
- Implement walls (are they called barriers?)
- Implement multiple levels
- Implement mothership
- Animate invaders (low priority)
